# RazorPagGen

This is a simple .Net Core program that can generate a Razor page my way.

I do not understand how the dotnet new page command works for creating a new Razor page.
I can get it to generate a page with a namespace but the page is created with the name of
the folder it is in as the model, suffixed with `Model`.

I apologize for the mis-spelling. It should be RazorPag**e**Gen, not RazorPagGen.
